Hello World Java Program HW2

Hello Java World,

My name is Alex, I do consider myself an explorer; I like to go in pursuit of new philosophies.  Communicate people my knowledge based on my skills (this is mostly in general such as work, home, and school or even in any public places). I am very optimistic and passionate. It will take a lot to carry me down.
